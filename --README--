To whom it may concern,

The unauthenticated creation of users a concern.  There must be a better way.

Espeically on update.  I'd require a token there, but the API does not.

i switched the database to storing bcrypt hashes instead of plaintext for
passwords so if we were compromised, we have some protection.  I didn't
use the recommended number of rounds because my dev box couldn't hack it.

JWT tokens have no expiry in this setup so if they are compromised, that's
a problem.  But I did update the JWT secret not to be a simple plaintext
string.  It is a hash from /dev/random on my mac taken with:

dd if=/dev/random bs=1k count=1 | shasum

I didn't get to play with async as much I might have liked given that this
was my first project with:

- express
- mongodb
- mongoose

I hope you enjoy my efforts,
